# POTA GB Map

[Access the map](https://kwirk.github.io/pota-gb-map)

This provides a simple map with many GB land designations (e.g. SSSI, National Nature Reserves)
with [Parks on the AirÂ® (POTA)](https://parksontheair.com/) references overlaid to help with
planning activities and identifying the correct boundaries.

The map must be zoomed into a minimum level for data to appear. Also, by default, larger layers such as AONB and SSSI are disable due to their larger size, but can be toggled on by the layer controls (top right).

Currently limited to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), but looking to expand with additional sources are found.
