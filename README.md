# UK Portable Ham Map

**[Access the map](https://kwirk.github.io/pota-gb-map)**

This provides a simple map with many GB/NI land designations (e.g. SSSI, National Nature Reserves)
with [Parks on the AirÂ® (POTA)](https://parksontheair.com/),
[World Wide Flora and Fauna (WWFF)](https://wwff.co/),
[Summits on the Air (SOTA)](https://www.sota.org.uk/),
[HuMPs Excluding Marilyns Award (HEMA)](http://hema.org.uk/),
[UK Bunkers on the Air (UKBOTA)](https://bunkersontheair.org/),
[English Castles Awards (ECA)](https://englishcastlesawards.uk/),
[English Lighthouse Awards (ELA)](https://englishlighthouseawards.uk/),
and [Work All Britain (WAB) Trig Points](https://wab.intermip.net/Trig%20Points%20Award.php)
references overlaid to help with
planning activities and identifying the correct boundaries.

It also includes an overlay for OSGB, Irish and Channel Islands MGRS squares
for [Work All Britain (WAB) Squares Award](https://wab.intermip.net/WAB%20Squares%20Award.php).

The map must be zoomed into a minimum level for data to appear. Also, by default, larger layers such as AONB and SSSI are disabled due to their larger size impacting performance and cluttering the display, but can be toggled on by the layer controls (top right).

Currently limited to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland,
for many of boundary layers, but includes Channel Islands and Isle of Man applicable programmes.
